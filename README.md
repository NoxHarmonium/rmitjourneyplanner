rmitjourneyplanner
==================

This is now the new home for the RMIT Journey Planner, a public transport journey planning system using genetic algorithms.
I developed this code as part of a studentship I undertook in the summer of 2011 and as the main focus of my honours thesis.

It is currently not very polished as it was under rapid development towards the end of my thesis but it will be under heavy
development in the next few weeks so that it can be used with different public transport data sources and used by people not familar with the code.
