==================

This is now the new home for the RMIT Journey Planner, a public transport journey planning system using genetic algorithms.
I developed this code as part of a studentship I undertook in the summer of 2011 and as the main focus of my honours thesis.

It is currently not very polished as it was under rapid development towards the end of my thesis but I am working on it so that it can be used with different public transport data sources and used by people not familar with the code. 

If you want to write your own program to experiment with the system, CoreLibraries contains all the functionallity that you can hook into. JRPCServer is a JSON API and associated client to hook into CoreLibraries.
